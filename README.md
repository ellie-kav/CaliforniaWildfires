# üå≤ California Wildfires

**A geospatial machine learning system for predicting property damage risk from California wildfires - expanded beyond UCD‚Äôs COMP47350 coursework.**

---

## üìö Project Overview
This project builds on the initial **COMP47350** assignment, which focused on binary classification of wildfire damage using a subset of CAL FIRE‚Äôs public [Damage Inspection (DINS)](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/cal-fire-damage-inspection-dins-data) dataset.  
The original work trained and evaluated linear regression, logistic regression, and random forest models to predict whether a structure would be **‚ÄúNo Damage‚Äù** or **‚ÄúDestroyed (>50%)‚Äù** based on descriptive features.

The expanded version moves from binary classification to **dollar‚Äëvalue damage estimation** and **geospatial risk mapping**. It integrates CAL FIRE fire perimeters, NOAA historical weather, USGS vegetation indices (NDVI), and property value data to model wildfire impact at a given location and time.
